# MoneyHub

I am building this because I wanted an app to help me track my finances but most of them wanted me to buy premium to access some features I needed. So I decided to build my own.

MoneyHub is a personal finance management system built with Spring Boot. 
It allows users to track income and expenses, categorize transactions, and monitor their financial activities.

## Description

MoneyHub helps users manage their finances by providing features such as:

- Adding and categorizing transactions (income and expenses)
- Viewing transaction history
- Generating summary reports for income and expenses
- Secure authentication using JWT
